About:
Dedicated future junior web developer looking to utilize teamwork, curious nature, problem-solving skills and creativity to make a powerful impact.

Born and raised in Belarus, a beautiful country in Eastern Europe, I am now live in the Washington DC area. I am fond of photography, reading, creating something with my own hands, being connected to the nature. 
I speak English, Russian and Belarusian. The JavaScript language will soon be under my belt too.
